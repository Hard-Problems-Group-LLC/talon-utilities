Installation Instructions - Talon Utilities
--------------------------------------------------------

1. REQUIREMENTS:
   - Python 3.6+ (Yes, the future is now.)
   - External Clipboard Utilities:
       • xclip       (for X11 systems)
       • xsel        (an alternative for X11)
       • wl-clipboard (provides wl-copy for Wayland)
     (Install at least one of these to ensure the scripts function properly.
      Without one, you're essentially fighting an uphill battle against the intangible.)

   Supported Operating Systems:
       Ubuntu, RHEL 9.5, Fedora 41

2. INSTALLER:
   - A thorough installer is provided in this project.
   - To install Talon Utilities, run the following command as root:
         sudo python3 install.py
     (If you encounter a version error, ensure you're using Python 3.6 or newer.)
   - Optional parameters:
         --bindir: Directory for executable scripts (default: /usr/local/bin)
         --mandir: Directory for man pages (default: /usr/local/share/man/man1)
   - The installer will:
         • Copy 'clip.py' and 'unclip.py' from the clip/ directory to the specified bindir,
           dropping the '.py' extension, and set executable permissions.
         • Copy the corresponding man pages ('clip.1' and 'unclip.1') to the specified mandir.
         • Refresh the man database (via 'mandb').

3. UNINSTALLATION:
   - To remove the installed utilities, delete the files from your bindir and mandir manually.

4. TROUBLESHOOTING:
   - The installer performs thorough checks and will halt on errors.
   - Ensure you are running the installer as root and that all dependencies are satisfied.
   - Check that the external clipboard utilities are installed if you plan to use clip/unclip.

5. REMOVAL:
   - Remove the installed files from your system if you no longer require the utilities.
