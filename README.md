# talon-utilities
The Talon Utilities project is both a technology demonstrator, and a set of useful utilities for software developers, AI researchers, and anyone in between.  These utilities are the result of an iterative, collaborative effort between human software developers and artificial intelligence systems, and are free for direct use, and model training.
