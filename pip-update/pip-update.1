.TH PIP-UPDATE 1 "February 2025" "Talon Utilities" "User Manuals"
.SH NAME
pip-update \- Automates bulk-updating of pip packages in Python.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pip-update
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIpip-update\fR utility attempts to upgrade all of your installed pip packages. It also runs 
\fIpip check\fR before and after the update, reporting any environment conflicts. If conflicts
already exist before updating, the script will refuse to proceed unless you specify the 
\fB\-\-force\fR flag.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB--skip PKG1 PKG2 ...\fR
Skip upgrading these package names.
.TP
\fB--dry-run\fR
Report what would be updated without actually upgrading anything.
.TP
\fB--force\fR
Proceed with upgrades even if there are existing pip conflicts. (Potentially reckless.)
.TP
\fB--nocolor\fR
Disable color output.
.TP
\fB--forcecolor\fR
Force color output (overrides TTY detection).
.TP
\fB--report FILE.json\fR
Write a JSON report capturing environment details, pre/post conflicts, and the final status of each upgrade attempt.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The program exits with 0 on success or if no updates are needed, 1 if a fatal error or conflict is encountered 
(and \fB\-\-force\fR is not used), or other non-zero codes if pip itself fails abruptly.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
  pip-update
  pip-update --skip pip setuptools
  pip-update --dry-run
  pip-update --force
  pip-update --report upgrade-results.json
.fi

(If you suffer any harm or existential dread from misused upgrades, that's on you.)

.SH BUGS
Pip's dependency resolver isn't actually a full solver, so expect surprises when you force updates.
