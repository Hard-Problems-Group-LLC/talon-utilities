TALON UTILITIES: CONTENTS
09FEB2025

This file provides a brief overview of the subproject utilities comprising the Talon Utilities suite. 
Each utility is designed to tackle a specific clipboard-related task with robust error handling and a healthy dose of pragmatism.

1. clip
   - Description: Copies text from standard input to the system clipboard.
   - Implementation: Leverages external clipboard utilities (xclip, xsel, or wl-copy) for graphical environments.
   - Behavior: If no suitable clipboard utility is available or the operation fails, the script terminates with an errorâ€”no temporary fallbacks here.
   - Usage: Pipe text into the script (e.g., `echo "Hello" | clip`).

2. unclip
   - Description: Retrieves text from the system clipboard and outputs it to standard output.
   - Implementation: Also relies on external clipboard utilities (xclip, xsel, or wl-copy) to interface with the clipboard.
   - Behavior: Fails with an error if no suitable utility is detected or if the retrieval operation fails.
   - Usage: Simply run the script (e.g., `unclip`) to print the clipboard content.

Additional utilities may be added in the future as the need arises.
