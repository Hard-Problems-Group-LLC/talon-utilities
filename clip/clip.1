.SH SYNOPSIS
.B clip
[\fB--utility\fR xclip|xsel|wl-copy] [\fB--interactive\fR | \fB--stream\fR] [file...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The clip utility reads text from standard input or file(s) and copies it to the system clipboard by
invoking an external clipboard utility. Supported utilities include:
.TP
\fBxclip\fR \- for X11 (requires the xclip package)
.TP
\fBxsel\fR \- for X11 (requires the xsel package)
.TP
\fBwl-copy\fR \- for Wayland (requires the wl-clipboard package)
.PP
In STDIN mode (when no file is specified), clip reads from standard input and copies the input to the
clipboard.
.PP
In File mode:
.IP
If exactly one file is provided (and neither --interactive nor --stream is specified), the file’s
content is read and copied to the clipboard immediately.
.IP
If multiple files (or a filespec matching multiple files) are provided, you must specify either the 
\fB--interactive\fR option or the \fB--stream\fR option:
.IP
\fB--interactive\fR: Processes files one-by-one. For each file, the filename, modification date, and size are displayed; the file’s content is copied to the clipboard; then the user is prompted:
"Copied. Press SPACE for next file or Q to quit."
.IP
\fB--stream\fR: Concatenates all files into a single buffer by wrapping each file’s content with markers.
The stream begins with a batch header that includes the username, hostname, working directory, and the
current timestamp. For each file, a header line:
.RS
"===========BEGIN FILENAME, MODIFIED TIMESTAMP==========="
.RE
precedes the file content, and a footer line follows:
.RS
"===========END FILENAME, TOTAL BYTE_COUNT BYTES==========="
.RE
After processing all files, a final batch footer is appended:
.RS
"========END BATCH TRANSFER, TOTAL N FILES, TOTAL_BYTES bytes========"
(possible witty quip)
"============================================================"
