.TH CLIP 1 "February 2025" "Version 1.0" "Talon Utilities"
.SH NAME
clip \- copy text from standard input to the system clipboard
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B clip
[\fB--utility\fR xclip|xsel|wl-copy]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The clip utility reads text from standard input and copies it to the system clipboard by
invoking an external clipboard utility. Supported utilities include:
.TP
\fBxclip\fR \- for X11 (requires the xclip package)
.TP
\fBxsel\fR \- for X11 (requires the xsel package)
.TP
\fBwl-copy\fR \- for Wayland (requires the wl-clipboard package)
.PP
If no suitable clipboard utility is found or if the copy operation fails, clip terminates with an
error message suggesting the necessary installation. (No silent fallback here—if your system
isn’t set up, you get a message, not a temporary file in /tmp.)
