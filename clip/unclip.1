.TH UNCLIP 1 "February 2025" "Version 1.0" "Talon Utilities"
.SH NAME
unclip \- paste text from the system clipboard to standard output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B unclip
[\fB--utility\fR xclip|xsel|wl-copy]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The unclip utility retrieves text from the system clipboard by invoking an external clipboard utility.
Supported utilities include:
.TP
\fBxclip\fR \- for X11 (requires the xclip package)
.TP
\fBxsel\fR \- for X11 (requires the xsel package)

.PP
If no suitable clipboard utility is found or if the paste operation fails, unclip terminates with an
error message suggesting the necessary installation. (No silent fallback here—if your system isn’t set up,
you get a message, not an empty output.)
